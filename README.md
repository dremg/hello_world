This is a foray into learning a Version Control System (VCS), specifically the GitHub VCS, to place the code I develop in a location where I and others may see and use it.

By the completion of this simple GitHub tutorial, a user should be able to articualte and 
demonstrate the following concepts, using GitHub:

1) Create a repository,
2) Upload to a repsoitory,
3) Create and manage a new branch,
4) Make chages to a file and push them to GitHub as commits, 
5) Open a pull request, and
6) Merge a pull request.

This tutorial is based upon the Hello World VCS tutorial on GitHub Guides 
(https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/).

"# hello_world"  init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/dremg/hello_world.git
git push -u origin master
